               <P>The website Solgen power uses "white space and clean Design" I think very well. They so not over crowd their sections. As well as leaving the background white it alows the space to feel more open. Along with the dark typeface making it easy to read.</P>

               <h4>Rule of Thirds</h4>

               <P>Mud photography folows the rule of thirds by having their home page devided into tree different sections. The first being the navagation screens next a video and third an art gallory. </P>

               <h4>Alignment</h4>
               <h5>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h5>
               <h5>https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng</h5>
               <img src="image_123986672 (2).JPG" alt="The CHurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Website Screenshot">
               <P>I think the churches home page shows the principle of alignment very well. On the home page they have many navagation screens for you to click on and read. They are all nicely aligned with each other making the page very organzied and appealing to the eye.</P>
