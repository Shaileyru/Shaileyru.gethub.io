                <p class="history-lesson">
                    The Maya are believed to have first settled Cozumel by the early part of the 1st millennium AD, and older Preclassic Olmec artifacts have been found on the island as well.
                    The island was sacred to Ix Chel, the Maya Moon Goddess, and the temples here were a place of pilgrimage, especially by women desiring fertility.
                    There are a number of ruins on the island, most from the Post-Classic period. The largest Maya ruins on the island were near the downtown area and have now been destroyed.
                    Today, the largest remaining ruins are at San Gervasio, located approximately at the center of the island.<br><br>

                <p class="attraction-lesson">
                    Cozumel is surrounded by a diverse ecosystem of coral reefs that is home to more than 1,000 marine species.
                    The reefs are primarily found on underwater cliffs, there are also some in coastal lagoons and on sand bars at the north tip of the island.
                    They are part of the much larger Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System which is the second largest reef in the world, stretching over 1,000 kilometers (620 mi). 
                    Cozumel's deeper coral reefs were historically famed for their black corals, yet black coral populations declined from the 1960s to the mid-1990s because of overharvesting and by 2016 had not recovered.
                    A huge portion of the reef on the south side of island is sectioned off into the Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park.
